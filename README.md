## Reasoning of this project  

Not every student are in positions where they would be able to afford a laptop that would be suited for the tasks they are required to complete. For this reason, Universities usually provide conputer labs that students would be able to access to complete their tasks,homework or for general studies. But with the COVID-19 pandemic, options are limited for some students. As such this set of code was written from which institutions/others can refer from and implement.
